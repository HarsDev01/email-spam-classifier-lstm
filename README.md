# ML-Project
Email Spam Classification Model
● Develop a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content.
● Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the email text data.
● Build and train a deep learning model using LSTM architecture to leverage the sequential nature of text.
● Fine-tune the model to improve performance using callbacks like EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau.
● Deploy the trained model to classify new email messages for real-time spam detection.
